# Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Pandas

This project demonstrates various data visualization techniques using Matplotlib,Pandas and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebooks. It was created to improve my knowledge and skills in data analysis and visualization.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.
2. Install required libraries:
   ```
   pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-visualization.git
   cd data-visualization
   ```

## Usage

1. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open the `data_visualization.ipynb` file in your browser.
3. Run the cells in order to see the visualizations.

## Guide

This notebook covers the following visualization techniques:

- Line plots: Trend analysis over time
- Scatter plots: Relationship between two variables
- Bar charts: Comparison between categories
- Histograms: Distribution of a dataset
- Box plots: Summary of descriptive statistics
- Heatmaps: Correlation between multiple variables

Each section includes:
- A brief explanation of the technique
- Sample code to create the visualization
- Interpretation of the results

Feel free to modify the code and experiment with your own datasets!
